### Programming for Data Science Nanodegree
This repository contains work completed during this nanodegree, specifically using SQL, Python, and Git.
Git was used to upload the both projects, each done in SQL and Python.

### Project 1 Description
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals by running SQL queries and building visualizations. Specifically, I answered the below four questions:
- Question 1: Which family movie category is most rented?
- Question 2: How long are movies rented for?
- Question 3: Is there a correlation between rental duration and the number of movies rented?
- Question 4: How do two stores compare in terms of rental counts during every month for all years on               record?

### Project 1 Files

The sample database used can be found <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/"> here</a>.

### Project 2 Description
In this project, I wrote code using Python to explore and answer questions about data from 3 major US cities that have bicycle-sharing systems.
